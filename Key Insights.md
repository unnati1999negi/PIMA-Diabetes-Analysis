# Key Insights â€“ PIMA Diabetes Analysis Dashboard ðŸ©º

## Overview  
This document highlights key insights derived from the PIMA Diabetes Analysis Dashboard created in Excel. The dashboard focuses on diabetes prevalence, health metrics, and risk level distribution across age groups, pregnancy counts, and diabetes outcomes.

## ðŸ“Š Insights by Visualization  

### 1. **Diabetes Prevalence by Age Brackets**  
- **Age Group Distribution**:  
  - **10.94%** of diabetes cases are in individuals under 30 years old.  
  - **19.01%** are between 30â€“50 years, and **69.95%** are aged 50+.  
- Diabetes is significantly more prevalent in older individuals (50+).

---

### 2. **Diabetes Pedigree Function by Outcome**  
- The average **Diabetes Pedigree Function** (DPF) is higher for individuals with diabetes (**0.55**) compared to those without diabetes (**0.43**).  
- This highlights the genetic predisposition of individuals with diabetes.  

---

### 3. **Pregnancy Count by Diabetes Outcome**  
- Women with **0 pregnancies** had fewer diabetes cases (**38 cases**) than women with **3â€“4 pregnancies** (**146 cases**).  
- The highest diabetes prevalence is among women with **5â€“6 pregnancies**.  

---

### 4. **Risk Levels Across Age Groups**  
- Individuals under 30 years:  
  - **237 cases** classified as "High Risk".  
  - **199 cases** classified as "Normal Risk".  
- Older groups (50+) have significantly lower "High Risk" cases, indicating that preventive care reduces risks over time.

### 5. **Average Health Metrics by Diabetes Outcome**  
- **Glucose Levels**:  
  - Average glucose level is **141.26 mg/dL** for individuals with diabetes, compared to **109.98 mg/dL** for those without diabetes.  
- **BMI**:  
  - Average BMI for individuals with diabetes is **35.14**, compared to **30.30** for those without diabetes.  
- **Insulin**:  
  - Average insulin levels are higher in individuals without diabetes (**100.34 mIU/L**) compared to those with diabetes (**68.79 mIU/L**).  
- **Blood Pressure**:  
  - Average BP for individuals with diabetes is **70.82 mmHg**, slightly higher than **68.18 mmHg** for those without diabetes.

---

### 6. **Risk Level Distribution**  
- **High Risk**:  
  - Represents **33 cases** in the dataset, predominantly in the <30 and 30â€“50 age brackets.  
- **Normal Risk**:  
  - Majority of individuals (**235 cases**) fall under the "Normal Risk" category, primarily in older age groups.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Recommendations  

1. **Preventive Interventions**:  
   - Focus on early screening and intervention for individuals in the **50+ age group**, where diabetes prevalence is highest.  

2. **Pregnancy Monitoring**:  
   - Provide targeted support and monitoring for women with **3â€“6 pregnancies**, as this group shows higher diabetes prevalence.  

3. **Lifestyle Changes**:  
   - Encourage lifestyle modifications, particularly for individuals with **high BMI and glucose levels**.    

By implementing these strategies, healthcare providers can better manage and prevent diabetes while addressing high-risk groups effectively.
